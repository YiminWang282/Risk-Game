# Risk-Game(KILL ZOMBIES)
A simple Risk Game(with interface)

# BACKGROUND
The game is an interactive adventure combat game in which the player fights zombies, buys supplies and stays healthy. Set in a city overrun by zombies due to a viral outbreak, the player must defeat different zombies in various scenarios, rescue his daughter trapped in the basement of a school, and escape the city via a helicopter on the roof. Weaving through dangerous paths full of crises, there is always the danger of death.

# INTRODUCTION
Player needs to enter a customized name to play the game, and can also freely choose a character image 
to play the game (but choosing a character image is not mandatory, if not, it defaults to the image on the left).

Four buttons at the bottom of the main screen are ATTACK, CURE, PICK and STORE. Except for the STORE button, there are restrictions on the use of each of these buttons: ATTACK can only be triggered when there is a zombie in the room, and CURE can only be triggered when the player is not at full blood level and has been raped. CURE can only be used when the player is not fully bloodied and has medicine in his backpack.

After both winning the game and dying from a zombie attack, a third GUI is automatically opened, and the player can choose to restart the game or end it.
